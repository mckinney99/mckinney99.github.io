      <p>I’m about a quarter way through the online web dev class, and although it took a while, I feel I’ve finally found a good pattern for studying and learing to code. If you feel frustrated with the curriculum you are learning on, or feel like you haven’t been learning as much as you wish, try following the steps I use below. I can’t gaurantee anything, but these techniques have definitley helped me out more than a few times.</p>

<p><strong>When in doubt, Repl.it out</strong></p>

<p>Thats: https://repl.it/</p>

<p>Repl is a beautiful website that allows you to select your coding language, and code right into your browser without having to setup a whole new project, run tests, etc. It’s super easy to use, and a must for any new student. Anytime a new concept is brought up, I almost immedietly open up an example in repl, and start playing with it. Sometimes the page describes these concepts almost perfectly, other times I find the page to lack a decent description or user funcationalitity on what exactly this concept is/does. When I play around with new concepts in repl, it sticks. I understand without being explained to. It’s more hands on, and thats how I learn best.</p>

<p><strong>Books Books Books</strong></p>

<p>I was struggleing hard through the first half of OO Ruby when my advisor suggested a book. “The Well-Grounded Rubyist” by David A. Black. I was hesitant at first, but went ahead and bought the book. The second I opened the first page I could not put it down. Concepts of the language we’re being explained to me in a totally different light. Some better, and some worse. I felt gaps in my knowledge of Ruby, but after reading just the first 100 pages of this book, I feel most those gaps are now filled. Throughout the Flatiron course, I plan on having a book by my side as I go through and learn each lesson. Right now I typically do the lessons during the day, and read at night. This helps solidify what I’ve already learned, and expand on what I haven’t.</p>

<p><strong>Create Your Tool Kit</strong></p>

<p>I would highly recommend creating a folder or notebook on a cloud drive (Google Drive, Evernote, Dropbox, etc.) so you can refer to it on any device. I created an Evernote notebook all about ruby, and store all of the descriptors, enumerables, and general tools and functions I am able to use on a daily basis. This really helps when you just can’t quite remember the syntax for something, and you can quickly and easily access it within your own system. Keep everything as organized as possible, however don’t hesitate to add the little things. You can always remove them down the line. If you never write them down, then how will you know what to search for when you really need the help later!? Take notes!</p>

<p>and finally:</p>

<p><strong>Go Slow!</strong></p>

<p>If my mind is not in the right setting, I struggle. You need to be calm and relaxed if you really want to learn code. Take each failure, and each line of code with thought. It takes times. Learning to code involves a lot of patience, and brain power. You need to give your brain breaks throughout the day. Have side projects of things to do not in front of a computer screen. I work best when I’m inspired, curious, and relaxed. Don’t get itchy trying to solve problems as quick as possible. It only hurts you down the line.</p>

<p>I hope these methods that have saved me in the past will continue to help others on their journey of learning to code.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>
